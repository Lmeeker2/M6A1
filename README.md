 ## Before starting this module please install
 # npm install express, npm install mongoose, npm install config, npm install jsonwebtoken, npm install bcryptjs

 # to start this lab (once all packages are installed), run either nodemon app.js or node app.js, this will launch the instance and it should output in the terminal the following:
        # app running on port 3000...
        #MongoDB connection successful

# once it's running, we'll navigate to a separate web browser (in my instance I used an incognito window for chrome), we will then use ' http://localhost:3000/api/home' once on the home page, select "sign up", and then input your information required (account name, account type, email, account number, password). Once complete, you'll then click the sign up button. It will take you to a page where it gives you back the information + your instance id and date/time of when it was ran, this is after the validators successfully ran. If it doesn't meet the criteria of the validators, it will error out the page and stop the instance.
